        <h1>This Is Not<br>A Book</h1>

    <div class="intro">

        <p>A shift in modern culture has changed the way we think of printed design, but how is the future of print supposed to be defined when we try to convince ourselves that a screen is somehow an extension of the printed book? When analyzing the current state of the book as a practice of design, we can try and predict the future directions of the medium and see where it might land within the spectrum of design practices.</p>

        <p>Historically, the book is representational of the industrial values of mass communication. For hundreds of years, the printed book has been a source for knowledge, information and entertainment. But throughout the span of the modern technological revolution, we have seen a massive shift in the way that all of these things are transmitted across our world. The fact of the matter is, in a world of instant technological gratification, the book is no longer a useful tool for informative communication.</p>

        <p>So then what exactly is the role of the contemporary book? It is my opinion that the future of the book is one of artistic merit and novelty, rejecting the original notions of the printed page and moving towards a definition in art. The future of the book lies not in the adaptation of technological culture, but in building off of what it already does so well.</p>

        <h2>Quality Over Quantity</h2>
        
        <p><em>"Print is dead"</em>. This phrase seems to be brought up in the design community time and time again. Frankly, it is accurate – the state of mainstream printed media is at an all-time low, but who says that this is a bad thing? While the world of mainstream print has certainly plummeted, the quality of well-designed printed pieces is thriving. Thus, in a way, the downfall of the large-scale print industry is leading to an increase in quality within the print design industry as a whole. Designers are no long required to work solely on large scale informational documents - we have the internet for that. This gives designers the freedom to explore within the medium and re-appropriate the book from a more creative standpoint.</p>

    <div class="section">
    
        <h2>A Grassroots Movement</h2>
        
        <p>This niche approach to the book has greatly benefited the medium in terms of the design culture that surrounds it. We are experiencing a new renaissance of rich design culture in the printed medium, where zine culture is on the rise, ‘designer’ books continue to sell, and more and more artists and designers are taking to this medium to create some of their best works. This is where the future of book brings hope. As a medium, the book is continuing to make its mark within the contemporary design community, acting as an outlet for creative freedom that rejects the popularity of digital design.</p>
        
        <p>This rise in culture has ultimately lead to a wide variety of beautifully designed and well thought-out projects. One of these is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesmudgepaper.com/">The Smudge</a>, a new monthly publication designed by Chicago-based designer <a target="_blank" href="http://clayhickson.com/">Clay Hickson</a>. The Smudge acts as an homage to the zines created by Push Pin Studio which comment on the current political climate. Albeit based on historic concepts, The Smudge offers a look into what the contemporary book can hold.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Another example of this re-appropriation of the book is the Martyrs project by Toronto-based design studio <a target="_blank" href="http://underlinestudio.com/">Underline</a>. This small pet project by the studio comes in the form of a small newsprint publication that offers insight into the 1980’s Civil War in El Salvador. This project takes elements of both art and design and uses them to create a project that is both meaningful and aesthetically beautiful. While at first glance it may appear to look like many other commercial newspapers, Underline has taken this convention of practical print design and further explored beyond its origins.</p>

        <h2>A Reversal of Roles</h2>
        
        <p>Another way in which we can predict the future of the book lies in how we look at the ways in which the book and the screen interact with one another. While many people believe that the book is shifting towards the screen, I would argue that true value is found when the screen shifts towards the book. In recent years, many blogs, studios and companies have taken projects that live solely on the screen and repurposed them into printed works with great results.</p>
        
        <p>Recently, Google commissioned a series of publications by an American designer named <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chadkloepfer.com/">Chad Kloepfer</a> to coincide with a conference held by their <a target="_blank" href="https://design.google.com/span-2016-tokyo/">Material Design</a> team. The publication, called Span, showcases many of the ideologies practiced by the Google team, all focusing on the world of screen-based interaction design.</p>
        
        <img class="span-1" src="img/Span-1.png">
        
        <p>What is interesting about this project is the way that Kloepfer crossed between the two worlds of design and beautifully brought many of these digital ideas into the print universe. The Span publications showcase a unique new concept in which screen and print work harmoniously with one another. In this situation, it is clear that each practice has its own purpose.</p>
        
        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/Span-4.png">
            <img src="img/Span-3.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>In a way, this can be seen as a signifier of these ideas surrounding the future of the book. Why would a technology company produce a printed book in 2017? Put simply, the book offers a clear and set role that simply can’t be reproduced on screen. When looking through the Span series, it is evident that the project holds deep aesthetic beauty while still showcasing effective communication design, creating an experience that could only function within this specific medium. </p>

        <h2>Where Do We Leave Off?</h2>
        
        <p>The fact of the matter is: the book isn’t dying, it’s simply changing. Much like many other forms of art and design, the book is undergoing a shift in which it must redefine itself to adapt to modern culture. Moving far from the utilitarian origins of books as a means of informative communication, the book has made a place in art, pushing forward the definition of contemporary design.</p>
